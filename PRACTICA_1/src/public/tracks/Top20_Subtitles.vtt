00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.937
mind when you work until three.

31
00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:40.348
If you're leaving with me.

32
00:01:40.348 --> 00:01:41.811

33
00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:43.100

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
But when you call me baby

36
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I know I'm not the only one

37
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.000
We did everything right,

38
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.000

39
00:02:07.061 --> 00:02:10.878
In the game with you little stupid ass,
I'll give a fuck.

40
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.647
I don't give a fuck I don't I don't
I don't give a fuck bitch

41
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.647
I don't give a fuck about you

42
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.000
or anything that you don't give up
about you or anything that you do.

43
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.150
You might be right, but I don't care

44
00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:25.148
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

45
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
But the heart wants what it wants

46
00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:39.148
I'm thinking about how people
fall in love in mysterious ways

47
00:02:40.301 --> 00:02:41.528
Maybe just the touch

48
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.188
This is hungry work
Take me to church

49
00:02:46.141 --> 00:02:48.288
I'll worship like a dog at

50
00:02:48.341 --> 00:02:51.000
the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins

51
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.278
so you can shop in your night.

52
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.000
I gave you bass, you gave me sweet talk

53
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.118
Saying how I'm your number one

54
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.000
But I know you lie 
'Cause your lips are moving

55
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.100
love me harder

56
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.200
And if you really need me

57
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.200
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder

58
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.200
(Lo-love me harder)

59
00:03:16.111 --> 00:03:18.300
I still get jealous

60
00:03:18.441 --> 00:03:21.100
'Cause you're too sexy, beautiful

61
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.100
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (that's why)

62
00:03:26.371 --> 00:03:28.000
I still get jealous

63
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
'Cause we're young and we're reckless

64
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.000
We'll take this way too far

65
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.000
It'll leave you breathless

66
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Or with a nasty scar

67
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.200
Got a long list of ex-lovers

68
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:42.328
Don't believe me just watch

69
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.454
Don't believe me just watch

70
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.500
Don't believe me just watch

71
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:54.644
Don't believe me just watch

72
00:03:55.474 --> 00:03:56.797
Don't believe me just watch

73
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.000
Uptown (woo) funk you up (come on)
Uptown funk you up
