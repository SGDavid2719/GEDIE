'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass (bass, bass, bass, bass)
Yeah it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
But I can shake it, shake it like I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
All the right junk in all the right places
I see them magazines workin' that photoshop
We know that shit ain't real
Come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty beauty just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect
From the bottom to the top
Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size
She says, boys like a little more booty to hold at night
And no I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll
So, if that's what's you're into
Then go ahead and move along
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, hey
I'm bringing booty back
Go ahead and tell them skinny bitches that
No, I'm just playing I know y'all think you're fat
But I'm here to tell you
Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top
Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size
She says, boys like a little more booty to hold at night
You know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll
So, if that's what's you're into
Then go ahead and move along
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble

I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
(Said) I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
(Uh) I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble

        My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape
        Yeah, that was a set up for a punchline on duct tape
        Worried bout if my butt fake
        Worried 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
        These girls are my sons, John and Kate plus Eight
        When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
        Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of an update
        Hut one, hut two, big titties, big butt too
        Fuck with them real niggas who don't tell niggas what they up to
        Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
        These hoes couldn't test me even if their name was pop quiz
        Bad bitches who I fuck with, mad bitches we don't fuck with
        I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is cutlet
        Let it soak in, like seasonin'
        And tell 'em, bitches blow me, Lance Stephenson
        Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
        Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
        Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
        Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
        Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
        Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
        Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
        I got my real niggas here by my side, only
        I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
        But when that's over then I'm the first in line
        And the other day in her Maybach
        I thought goddamn, this is the perfect time
        We had just come from that video
        You know LA traffic, how the city slow
        She was sitting down on that big butt
        But I was still staring at the titties though
        Yeah, low-key or may be high-key
        I been peeped that you like me you know
        Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
        I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly, I mean
        She say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree, yeha
        That's right I like my girls BBW, yeah
        Type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you, yeah
        So thick that everyone else in the room is so uncomfortable
        Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Claire Huxtable
        Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
        The NBA players fuck with you
        The bad ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
        Oh, that's 'cause I believe in something, and I stand for it
        And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck
        Just give me the heads up so I can plan for it (Pinkprint, ayy)
        Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
        Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
        Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight

        I never fucked Nick' and that's fucked up
        If I did fuck she'd be fucked up
        Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
        'Cause she actin' like she need dick in her life
        That's another story, I'm no story teller
        I piss greatness like gold is yellow
        All my goons so overzealous
        I'm from Hollygroove, the holy Mecca
        Calendar say I got money for days
        I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
        My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she wave
        They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
        My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
        Don't have my money? I take mothers instead
        You got the hickups, you swallowed the truth
        Then I make you burp boy, treat beef like sirloin
        I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses with army guns
        So think about your son and daughter rooms
        Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns
        Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms
        This shit is crazy my nigga, I mean brazy my nigga
        That money talk, I just rephrase it my nigga
        Blood gang, take the "b" off behavior, my nigga for reals
        If you mouth off, I blow your face off
        I mean pop-pop-pop, then I take off
        Now you see me, nigga now you don't
        Like Jamie Foxx, acting like Ray Charles
        Sixteen in a clip, one in the chamber
        17 Ward bully with seventeen bullets
        My story is how I went from 'poor me'
        To 'please pour me a drink and celebrate with me'
        Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
        Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July

        Ooh, I want the time of my life (Mr. Worldwide)
        Oh baby, ooh
        Give me the time of my life (Ne-yo)
        Eh, eh, eh (Let's get it)
        Let's get it now
        This is the last $20 I got
        But I'ma have a good time ballin' or out
        Tell the bartender, line up some shots
        'Cause I'ma get loose tonight
        She's on fire, she's so hot
        I'm no liar, she burn up the spot
        Look like Mariah, I took another shot
        Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
        Dirty talk, dirty dance
        She a freaky girl and I'm a freaky man
        She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
        And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck
        I told her, "Wanna ride out?", and she said yes
        We didn't go to church, but I got blessed
        I knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago
        I worked my ass off, but I still can't pay it though
        But I got just enough
        To get off in this club
        Have me a good time, before my time is up
        Hey, let's get it now

        You know you got the biggest booty in this spot
        And I just wanna see that thing drop
        From the back to the front to the top
        You know me, I'm off in the cut
        Always like a squirrel, looking for a nut
        This isn't for show I'm not talking 'bout luck
        I'm not talking 'bout love, I'm talking 'bout lust
        Now let's get loose, have some fun
        Forget about bills and the first of the month
        It's my night, your night, our night, let's turn it up

        (Everybody goin' through something)
        So you might as well you roll it up

        But every day above ground is a great day, remember that (Dali!)
        I knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago

        And I can't sweep you off of your feet
        Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
        Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
        And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
        And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
        And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
        Maybe just the touch of a hand
        Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
        And I just wanna tell you I am
        So honey now
        Take me into your loving arms
        Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
        Place your head on my beating heart
        I'm thinking out loud
        Maybe we found love right where we are
        When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
        And the crowds don't remember my name
        When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm
        I know you will still love me the same
        'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen
        Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
        I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
        Maybe it's all part of a plan
        I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
        Hoping that you'll understand
        But baby now
        Take me into your loving arms
        Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
        Place your head on my beating heart
        I'm thinking out loud
        That maybe we found love right where we are, oh
        So baby now
        Take me into your loving arms
        Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
        Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
        I'm thinking out loud
        That maybe we found love right where we are
        Oh baby, we found love right where we are (maybe)

        She's the giggle at a funeral
        Knows everybody's disapproval
        I should've worshiped her sooner
        If the Heavens ever did speak
        She's the last true mouthpiece
        Every Sunday's getting more bleak
        A fresh poison each week
        'We were born sick', you heard them say it
        My church offers no absolutes
        She tells me, Worship in the bedroom'
        The only Heaven I'll be sent to
        Is when I'm alone with you
        I was born sick, but I love it
        Command me to be well
        A-, Amen, Amen, Amen
        Take me to church
        I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
        I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
        Offer me that deathless death
        Good God, let me give you my life
        Take me to church
        I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
        I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
        Offer me that deathless death
        Good God, let me give you my life
        If I'm a pagan of the good times
        My lover's the sunlight
        To keep the Goddess on my side
        She demands a sacrifice
        Drain the whole sea
        Get something shiny
        Something meaty for the main course
        That's a fine looking high horse
        What you got in the stable?
        We've a lot of starving faithful
        That looks tasty
        That looks plenty
        This is hungry work
        Take me to church
        I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
        I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
        Offer me my deathless death
        Good God, let me give you my life
        Take me to church
        I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
        I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
        Offer me my deathless death
        Good God, let me give you my life
        No masters or kings when the ritual begins
        There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
        In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
        Only then I am human
        Only then I am clean
        Oh, oh, Amen, Amen, Amen
        Take me to church
        I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
        I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
        Offer me that deathless death
        Good God, let me give you my life
        Take me to church
        I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
        I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
